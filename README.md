Rock-Paper-Scissors Motion Capture Game
This collaborative project with [Robotics Lab Name] transforms the classic game of Rock-Paper-Scissors into an interactive experience using motion capture and robotics! Players wear marker clusters to control the movements of two robotic hands, engaging in a real-time Rock-Paper-Scissors match with their bodies. Our motion capture system detects player gestures and translates them to the robot hands, creating an immersive, hands-free gameplay experience for kids.

Features
Real-Time Gesture Recognition: Motion capture system identifies player movements and interprets them as rock, paper, or scissors gestures.
Robot Hand Control: Player movements are mapped to the robotic hands, enabling seamless interaction.
Educational and Fun: Designed to introduce kids to motion capture and robotics in an engaging, playful way.
